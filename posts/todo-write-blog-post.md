One of the difficult things about writing software is that there is an infinite amount of things to do, but only a finite
amount of time to complete them. This means that software is never finished, it is always in progress. One of the ways
that this truth is communicated is through comments and documentation.

Comments contain lots of valuable information about things that are being worked on, things that should be worked on,
and things that were worked on. Over time
