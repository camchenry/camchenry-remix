In 2018, React gained the Hooks API and completely changed how we write React applications.
As a result, many of the patterns that were previously "best practices" no longer applied. Hooks require a complete
rethink of how we build React applications.

Unfortunately, this means that many articles, courses, and talks from the "pre-Hooks" era are not as helpful as they
used to be. It can be difficult to figure out what is relevant to "modern React" (with Hooks) and pre-hooks React,
especially if you are a new React developer.
